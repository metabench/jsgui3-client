// May need to change around a fair few references to make it workable.
// May need some more complicated logic to change it to the path for service.

// There can be a client app that's specifically for a resource.
//  That's a special case.
// Other client side apps will access multiple resources.
//  They can do this through a Resource_Pool.
//  There could be client-side resources that make use of information sharing between these client and server side resources.

// This client resource could reference a remote resource.

// Will have client-remote-reference resource
//  maybe just client-remote
//  will work in a similar way to remote or node-remote in terms of API, but internally it will do HTTP calls differently.
//  Possibly could just use jsgui though, have it expose the same API for node and the client.

// This one is still fairly abstract.
//  It will be the client-remote-link resource which will have the functionality.
//  client-remote-link will connect with websockets to get events
//  it will do get with http.


// A resource control will recieve events from the client resource.
//  It may also ensure it has been set up.

// Also a Resource_Client file that sets up a resource connection with a particular resource?
//  Maybe don't set up such abstract resource linking for the moment?

// With the Resource-Client architure, we could define the back-end in terms of a Resource, and not need to write various pieces of boilerplate for them
//  to communicate with each other.

// Resource_Client may be a necessary JS file.
//  Would be JavaScript that runs on a page that's for when it's the client for a single resource?

// With the clock resource, would want it to have a resource control.
//  That control could possibly speak to the resource directly.
//  It could possibly speak to a client-side resource / aggregator that then speaks to the server resource.

// Serving a page with a component that connects back to the resource...
//  I think a lot of the activity will be in the user control,
//  however, it may be that the user control will just be making use of the client-side resources or client-side resource pool.
